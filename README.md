A project -

1. covering and sharing all the useful tools, snippets, regex patterns, template modules and various other flotsam used to speedup writing verilog and VHDL
2. covering customizations to Vim (or possibly other CLI editors) to improve and accelerate writing up verilog and VHDL
3. ... more I'm sure the door is open to possibilities galore
